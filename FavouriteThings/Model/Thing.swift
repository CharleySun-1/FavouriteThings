         New Balances are just amazing, they're one of the old running shoes brand in the world right now, I used to think they are lame because they weren't as "cool" as Nikes and Adidas. However, I learnt that the point of buying shoes are just to wear them, so my opinion on shoes changed, I stopped to buy more shoes that I don't need, instead I bought something that are comfy.
         I also like the combination of grey and white so these pair are my favourite.

            Rainbow six siege is the other game that I like to play the most, it is a first person shooting game, it's online as well.
           

            Personally , I think there are a lot of benefits of gaming, especially if I'm doing it moderately. While gaming, my brain will work faster because I'm focused, so at least during that period of time I'll guaranteed to use my brain. This is also why my brain gets tired after several hours of gaming.
